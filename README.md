# Python
Some codes in Python like applications, simple games, projects, exercises and basic material.

<strong>1- python-codes-CEV</strong> : A lot of examples in Python using old and new scripts. All codes were originally done as exercises and challenges at https://www.cursoemvideo.com/ in a course developed by <strong>@gustavoguanabara</strong>. 90% of them translated to English by myself (still working on it), added new comments and changed some lines.
