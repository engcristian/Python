# Python
Some codes in Python like applications, simple games, projects, exercises and basic material.

<strong>1- python-codes-CEV</strong> : A lot of examples in Python using old and new scripts. All codes were originally done as exercises and challenges at https://www.cursoemvideo.com/ in a course developed by <strong>@gustavoguanabara</strong>. 90% of them translated to English by myself (still working on it), added new comments and changed some lines.

<strong>2- python-codes-DIO</strong>: Functions, classes, methods, trating erros and requisitions from a course <strong>'Introdução à programação com Python'</strong> at https://web.digitalinnovation.one developed by <strong>Digital Innovation One</strong> and <strong>Rafael Galeanni</strong>. The codes are mixed Portuguese and English (will translate all later)
